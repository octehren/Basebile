###High-level description
Basebile is a mobile baseball game. The player is the batter and is able to throw away balls thrown by the thrower (the computer) by either tapping on the screen or shaking the phone. There is a quick sprite animation each time the batter tries to deflect a ball and each the the thrower throws a ball at the batter. If the batter successfuly deflects the ball, the ball goes quickly offscreen by the upper-side of the phone. Otherwise, the ball leaves the mobile phone screen by either the left or right side (defined randomly at each failed attempt).
